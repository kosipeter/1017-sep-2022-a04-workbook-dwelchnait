                    Optionally: one can had their head titles on the rows
                     here the developer uses the 1st column (general) as
                     the titles for the data.
                     if you are designing your table in this fashion then
                        a thead area is not needed AND the first cell on

                    see above for using <th> cell if you wish your headings
