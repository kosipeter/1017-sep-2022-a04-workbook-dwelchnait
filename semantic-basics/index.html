            <h2>Cycling in Tuscany</h2>
            <p>Bike on quiet roads over rolling hills through the heart of Tuscany. 
                Perhaps stopping for a long lunch at a local vineyard, medieval town
                 or just a roadside field where you can kick back and enjoy an 
                 afternoon snooze.  Gorgeous golden hillsides, rich artistic heritage, 
                 gentle biking paths and great food and wine at the end of a dayâ€™s 
                 cycling make this tour a perfect mix of what makes Tuscany great.
            </p>
