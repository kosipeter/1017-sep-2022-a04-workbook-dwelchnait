            This is an anchor tag and is incorrectly often referred to as the
                link tag
            One should NOT use the link tag because ther is actually a <link>
                used in the ,head> section
            The anchor tag can take you to a different location whether it
                be on a different website, different page in the current web site
                or a different location on the current page

            parameters:
            href: points to the desired location
            target: indicates the browser page display option
                    default is same display page tab

        <h2>Image tag</h2>
        <!--an empty (void) tag 
            image tag does not have a closing tag
            the image tag has no content, however is does have parameters

            parameters
            src="relative web site location"
            alt="printable text if the image is not found at src"
            [title="tool tip text for the image"]

            Absolute Addressing is a complete fixed file path
                drive:/folder/..../folder/filename.ext

            relative address begins at a specific point
            for web sites, it is the "top of the web site"
            reference to the desired filename is done by specifying
                the appropriate folder path to the desired file
            NO DRIVE

            Movement with a relative address
            - if only the filename is given, the location is within the
                same folder
            - movement down the file structure is by /foldername
            - movement up the file structure is by using .. for each
                folder level to ascend

            same folder
             ="filename.ext"

            lower folder

            from one lower folder to another lower folder on a different branch
            .. for each level that needs to be ascended
